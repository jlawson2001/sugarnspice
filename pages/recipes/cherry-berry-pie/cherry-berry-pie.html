  <p>this recipe is borrowed from my friends at <a href= "https://www.garlicandzest.com/summer-cherry-berry-pie/" class="p_a">Garlic and Zest</a>, but it was so unbelievably delicious when I made it that I just had to share!</p>

  <p>i’ve always been fond of summertime, and especially all the delicious fruit that comes with it! i have memories of playing outside with my friends as a child, splashing around in the pool or running about the lawn, then biting into thick, juicy cherries and watching the red juice drip down our arms. </p>

<br>
  <p>good cherries are, in my opinion, some of the best produce summer has to offer! these seasonal treasures, combined with my year-round loves, strawberries and blueberries, make an excellent pairing. </p>

<div class="a_list">
  <h3>ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>2- 9-inch pie crusts</li>
  <li>12oz. dark cherries, pitted</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups blueberries</li>
  <li>1 cup strawberries</li>
  <li>⅔ cup sugar</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
  <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon orange zest</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons juice from the orange</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon lemon zest</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon almond extract (substitute vanilla extract for nut allergies)</li>
  <li>1 egg, beaten + 2 tablespoons water</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons demerara sugar for dusting</li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="a_list">
  <h3>directions:</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>In a large bowl, combine the sugar, cornstarch, salt, orange zest, lemon zest, orange juice and almond extract.  Add the cherries and blueberries.  Toss to combine and set aside for 30 minutes.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Lay a sheet or two of plastic wrap on a work surface.  Place the pie crust on the plastic wrap.  Lay another sheet of plastic wrap over the pie crust.  Roll the pie crust out to a 12 -13" diameter.  Remove the top layer of plastic and transfer the crust to a 9" ceramic or glass pie plate.  Press the bottoms and sides firmly into the pie plate.  Use a sharp knife to trim the edges and refrigerate.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Place the second pie crust on the plastic wrap and cover with the second piece of plastic wrap.  Roll the second crust out to a 12"-13" diameter.  Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut the pastry into even, 3/4" strips.  Transfer the crust (plastic wrap and all) to a flat surface and refrigerate.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 400°.</li>
  <br>
  <li>When the berries have macerated for half an hour, give them a stir to ensure they're well combined with the sugar mixture and transfer the fruit to the pie shell and smooth to an even layer.  Lay 5 pieces of pastry strips. evenly spaced over the fruit and pie -- letting the ends hang over the sides of the shell.  Rotate the pie plate 90° and begin to weave the lattice with 5 remaining strips of pastry.  Tuck the hanging ends under the edge of the bottom crust and press together with a fork or create a fluted edge with your fingers.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash onto the lattice and edges of the crust.  Sprinkle the crust with demerara sugar.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Bake for 20 minutes.  Lay a flat piece of aluminum foil gently over the crust (to prevent over-browning) and continue baking for 40 minutes.  Remove from the oven and cool for at least an hour.  Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
