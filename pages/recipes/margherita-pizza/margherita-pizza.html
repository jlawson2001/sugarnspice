  <p>My love for Margherita stems from its inherently bountiful taste. More natural and wholesome than a regular cheese pizza, a good Margherita is made from the freshest of ingredients: ripe tomatoes, a rich mozzarella, and just-picked basil sprigs. </p>

  <p>On my trip to Italy last year, I was astonished to learn of the rich history of this pizza. Named for the country’s 19th century queen, it was meant to embody the Italian flag with its vibrant red, white, and green coloring!
    Also on that trip...i had the best pizza I’ve ever tasted in my life (and probably the best pizza I will ever taste in my life) at <a href= "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/the-worlds-best-pizzerias/pizzeria-naples/" class="p_a">L’Antica Pizzeria Da Michele</a> in Naples. Needless to say, I’ve been searching for the perfect alternative since.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This recipe also marks the first time I really began to get creative in the kitchen. My personal philosophy is that sometimes the best inventions come from sheer inspiration, and this pizza is a product of my own personal design...and my love for the savory tastes of Italy! Most of the time when I make it I don’t use a recipe, I just follow my soul and do what feels right.
     For those of us who prefer a bit more structure, however, i have perfected a recipe that will do justice to the spirit of creativity this pizza is meant to embody.</p>

  <p>Above all, I recommend not skimping on the olive oil! Right now, I use a jar of the finest basil-infused olive oil I’ve ever tasted, brought back from my trip to Spain last year. Believe me when I say that a good olive oil will take your margherita to the NEXT LEVEL. </p>

  <p>you can go through the toil of conjuring up your own dough if you like...but I say why mess with simplicity.
    I’m a fan of the publix pizza dough, but if you can’t locate good dough near you, try this recipe from my friends at <a href=”https://sugarspunrun.com/the-best-pizza-dough-recipe/” class="p_a">Sugar Spun Run</a>.</p>

  <h3>ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>1 pre-made pizza dough</li>
  <li>olive oil, to taste</li>
  <li>pesto, to taste</li>
  <li>3-4 vine-ripened tomatoes</li>

  <br>
  <div class="a_list">
  <h3>Instructions:</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>preheat oven according to the directions of your pizza dough.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Roll dough out onto a large greased cookie sheet or pizza tray (depending on your shape preference. I like rectangles), and knead well. </li>
  <br>
  <li>with a brush, lightly coat the dough with olive oil, covering completely. </li>
  <br>
  <li>spread a generous layer of pesto across the base of the pizza, creating an outline for the base and making sure to leave some blank crust on the sides. make sure the pesto is spread evenly across the dough.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Slice tomatoes (not too thick) and layer atop surface area of pizza.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Slice mozzarella as you wish (i prefer thick, round circles) and place slices atop of the tomatoes.</li>
  <br>
  <li>if needed, brush an additional coating of olive oil onto the crust. very lightly drizzle pizza with olive oil. </li>
  <br>
  <li>bake according to dough instructions, or until crust is nicely browned. keep in mind that you may need to add an additional 5-10 minutes if your pizza is especially rotund. </li>
  <br>
  <li>after popping the pizza out from the oven, sprinkle sprigs of fresh basil atop of it to taste. </li>
  </ol>
