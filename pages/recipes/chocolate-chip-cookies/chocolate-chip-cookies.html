  <p>Chocolate chip cookies were one of the first things I ever learned to bake. In our kitchen, my mother would show me how to measure everything out, mix it all together, and make something delicious out of ingredients that you may just have lying around your house.
    Loosely based on the <a href= "https://www.verybestbaking.com/recipes/18476/original-nestle-toll-house-chocolate-chip-cookies/" class="p_a">toll house cookies recipe</a>, This recipe is one of my favorites, and always goes over well with any audience. It’s sure to be a hit wherever you go!</p>

  <p>While loosely based on the toll-house recipe, through the years i’ve styled this recipe into something unique and fun with my own pizazz. I’ve played with infusing of dark and milk chocolate chips, pecans instead of walnuts, and cupfuls of oats (which I think add just the right amount of hearty richness).
    Over time, this version of the recipe has come to stabilize as my go-to...and the mini chocolate chips make it all the more spunky and fun!</p>
  <br>
  <p>This being said, feel free to make this recipe your own! Sometimes i add more oats, skip the nuts, or dump the entire bag of chocolate chips</p>

  <p> (which, if you decide to do...i won’t tell;)</p>
  <br>
  <p>The true beauty of this recipe lies in its versatility. You can enjoy this time-honored classic as is, in its simple perfection, or you can get creative with this time-honored classic and find a fun way to make it your own!</p>
