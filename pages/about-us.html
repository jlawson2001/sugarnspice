  <p>Sugar n’ Spice is a baking and lifestyle blog started in 2019 by our founder, Jenni Lawson.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Jenni has been baking since she was nine years old, and her biggest joy when it comes to food is getting creative in the kitchen!
    Here, she brings her passion for the culinary arts, her love of coding, and her eye for design to bring you the latest on what’s cooking in her kitchen.
    From new, original recipes released every week to some old favorites or borrowed recipes she loves to share, Jenni’s dream is to create a space where all kinds of cooking can be savored and enjoyed by all.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you’d like to stay in the loop on all things Sugar n’ Spice, feel free to <a href= "contact.html" class="p_a">subscribe</a> to receive weekly updates and other fun news.
